Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    81 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  81
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        137 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      135 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              91
      Number using O5 output only:              14
      Number using O5 and O6:                   30
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        16
    Number using O6 output only:                16

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    49 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          139
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            58 out of     139   41%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   2 out of     139    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          79 out of     139   56%
    Number of unique control sets:               9
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              19 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                         3 out of     480    1%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                       1 out of      60    1%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                  1
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               1
    Total Memory used (KB):                     18 out of   2,160    1%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
