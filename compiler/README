[Update on July 24, 2012]

- 32-bit x86 (with SSE2, that is, Pentium IV or later) is now
  supported (on Linux and Cygwin); execute ./to_x86 before make.

[Updates on September 17, 2008]

- PowerPC is now supported (in addition to SPARC), thanks to
  Ms. Masuko and Prof. Asai in Ochanomizu University.  You _must_
  execute either ./to_ppc or ./to_sparc _before_ make.

- The register allocator now uses a simpler algorithm.  It omits the
  backtracking (ToSpill and NoSpill) in previous versions.
